## 1. E-commerce Sales Data Cleaning

* **Tools Used:** Google Sheets, `TRIM()`, `PROPER()`
* **Objective:** To clean and prepare a raw dataset of 1000 supermarket sales transactions for analysis.
* **Process:**
    * Loaded the raw `.csv` data into Google Sheets.
    * Created new columns to clean and standardize text fields, correcting inconsistencies in capitalization and removing hidden whitespace.
    * Used the "Copy -> Paste Special -> Values only" method to create a final, clean dataset with reliable data integrity.
* **Outcome:** Successfully transformed a raw, messy dataset into a structured and clean format, making it ready for reliable analysis.
