## 1. E-commerce Sales Data Cleaning

* **Tools Used:** Google Sheets, `TRIM()`, `PROPER()`
* **Objective:** To clean and prepare a raw dataset of 1000 supermarket sales transactions for analysis.
* **Process:**
    * Loaded the raw `.csv` data into Google Sheets.
    * Created new columns to clean and standardize text fields, correcting inconsistencies in capitalization and removing hidden whitespace.
    * Used the "Copy -> Paste Special -> Values only" method to create a final, clean dataset with reliable data integrity.
* **Outcome:** Successfully transformed a raw, messy dataset into a structured and clean format, making it ready for reliable analysis.

## 2. Customer Behavior Analysis & Visualization

* **Tools Used:** Google Sheets, Pivot Tables, Charts
* **Objective:** To analyze the clean sales data to identify purchasing patterns across different customer segments.
* **Process:**
    * Created a Pivot Table to summarize 1000 sales transactions, counting payment method usage for both 'Member' and 'Normal' customer types.
    * Analyzed the aggregated data to extract a key business insight: Member customers prefer 'Cash', while Normal customers prefer 'Ewallet'.
    * Designed a stacked column chart to visually communicate this finding in a clear and professional format.
* **Outcome:** Translated raw data into an actionable business insight, providing a clear view of customer preferences.
